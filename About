Sentiment analysis using BERT-Large provides a powerful way to analyze emotions expressed in text data, including tweets from platforms like Twitter. In this implementation, we use the `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library to classify tweets into sentiment categories ranging from very negative to very positive. The model tokenizes the tweets, converting them into tokens that BERT can process, and outputs logits representing raw sentiment scores, which are converted into probabilities. BERT's bidirectional understanding of context enables nuanced analysis of complex tweet structures, capturing elements like sarcasm, negation, or slang commonly used on Twitter. Although BERT-Large is computationally intensive and has slower inference times, it excels in accuracy for context-dependent sentiment analysis of short texts like tweets. The implementation is versatile, supporting multiple languages, and can be extended for live Twitter sentiment monitoring through tools like Tweepy for real-time data collection. Future enhancements could include fine-tuning for domain-specific Twitter data, model optimization for faster performance, and real-time sentiment tracking, making it a robust solution for analyzing public opinions and trends on social media.
